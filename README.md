# 🧾 Invoice Renderer

> A modular and extensible invoice PDF generator using Spring Boot and a plugin-based architecture. Built with clean code principles and real-world customization features.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔌 **Plugin-based architecture** – Easily add/remove invoice data sections (e.g. logo, buyer, tax, order info)
- 🖨️ **HTML → PDF rendering** via [Flying Saucer PDF](https://github.com/flyingsaucerproject/flyingsaucer)
- 🧩 Custom fields – Auto-generate values like order number, date-time, and tax
- 🖼️ Embedded logo/image support (local file path)
- 📤 API-driven (REST endpoint to trigger invoice rendering)
- ⚡ Average PDF generation latency: **<100ms** (Docker container test)
- 💡 Designed with clean separation of concerns for production readiness
- 📄 **Deployed API available** – Test the live instance at: [https://invoice-renderer.onrender.com](https://invoice-renderer.onrender.com) 
- 📎 Supports **inline view and forced PDF download** using `?mode=inline` or `?mode=attachment`

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Build the project
```bash
mvn clean install
```

### 2. Start the Spring Boot app
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 3. Send a request
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/invoices -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
  -d '{
    "transactionId": "TXN123456",
    "copyType": "ORIGINAL",
    "amount": 1500
  }'
```

🧾 PDF gets saved in the `/output` folder.

## 🌐 Live API Demo 
You can test the deployed version here:

- 🔗 **Base URL**: [https://invoice-renderer.onrender.com](https://invoice-renderer.onrender.com)

### ✅ Available Endpoints:

- `GET /` → Returns a welcome message and lists available endpoints
- `POST /invoices` → Create and render invoice, returns JSON with `pdfUrl`
- `GET /invoices/{id}` → Fetch saved invoice metadata by ID
- `GET /invoices/pdf/{transactionId}` → View/download the rendered PDF  
  ⤷ Add `?mode=attachment` to trigger download instead of inline view

## 🧠 Sample Plugins

### ✔️ BuyerInfoPlugin
- Populates buyer details.

### ✔️ TaxInfoPlugin
- Calculates tax based on `copyType`

### ✔️ LogoPlugin
- Embeds a local logo from `/static/images/InvoiceLogo.png`

### ✔️ OrderInfoPlugin
- Fills order number, date-time, merchant name, currency, payment mode, delivery status, createdAt

## 🧩 Extending the Plugin System
To add a new plugin:

```java
@Component
public class CustomPlugin implements InvoicePlugin {
  public void apply(Invoice invoice) {
    invoice.setCustomField("...");
  }
}
```
Spring automatically discovers and applies it at runtime.
